todo:

- project setup
- gen from unstructured text w/o data persistence
- add data persistence
- customize including of pinyin. delete pinyin from existing cards
- allow clozing phrases to increase difficulty
- allow deleting tone markers from existing cards to increase difficulty
- gen from existing harvested sentences (compatibility with c-drama learning)

general ideas:

- learn vocab with higher level of context
- only use the target language
- add sentence-by-sentence / character breakdown of compound kanji words to source language to improve available context, but hide by default
- any way to improve encoding abilities of these sentences?
- question cards?
